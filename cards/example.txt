# The visual system
The visual system consists of two parts:
- An optical system that produces an image on the retina.
- An image-processing system. This spends most of its resources on the fovea.

---
# Layers of the eye 1
Light falls onto the _retina_ which is covered by the _macula_ filter which protects against UV and low wavelengths.

---
# Layers of the eye 2
Below the retina is the _choroid_ containing blood vessels. 

---
# Layers of the eye 3
The last layer is the _sclera_. It is white, except in front where it is transparent.

---
# Peak intensity of motopic vision is at a wavelength of around
- 400 nm
- 450 nm
- 500 nm
* 550 nm

# Retina
Part of the eye that turns _light_ into _electrical neural impulses_.

---
# Choroid
The choroid seperates from sclera and becomes the _ciliary body_, and then the _iris_.

---
# LGN
_lateral geniculate nuclei_

---
# LGN 6 layers
2 layers receive signals from _M_-ganglion cells.
4 layers receive signals from _P_-ganglion cells.
between is a thin layers that receives signals from _K_-ganglion cells.

# Color vision: types of cones
Three different types of cones, for different wavelengths.
S (short) corresponds roughly to the colour _blue_.
M (medium) corresponds roughly to the colour _green_.
L (long) corresponds roughly to the colour _red_.

---
# Color vision: color channels
Achromatic channel = M + L
Blue-yellow channel = M + L - S
Red-green channel = L + S - M
