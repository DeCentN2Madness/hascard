intrinsically photosensitive Retinal Ganglion Cell

---
# Layers of the eye I
Light falls onto the _retina_ which is covered by the _macula_ filter which protects against UV and low wavelengths.

---
# Layers of the eye 2
Below the retina is the _choroid_ containing blood vessels. 

---
# Layers of the eye 3
The last layer is the _sclera_. It is white, except in front where it is transparent.

---
# Retina
Part of the eye that turns _light_ into _electrical neural impulses_.

---
# Choroid
The choroid seperates from sclera and becomes the _ciliary body_, and then the _iris_.
